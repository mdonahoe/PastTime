Remember your life history! Find and organize your photos and videos.

Picasa and other services are nice, but they don't organize the underlying data.

I want something that cleans up my harddrives, renaming files.

I am tempted to use Flickr, or some other online service.
But I don't trust them to survive...

I also want to be able to review the data occasionally, and add tags. And invent my own system.

Here is what I had to say about this 3 years ago:

Imagine a device that you plug into any computer and it grabs all the photos off it.
Or a website you go to and it sends all your photos over the net
Instead of manually adding photos, you just grab them all, and then sort and label them later by viewing them in a slideshow thing.

A program could search through a computer and find all the image files, ignoring duplicates, and placing them on the drive. Then you run a labeling server that shows you images and you type people you see and places etc.

tagging

Matchin, ESP game, google image labeler

find visually similar photos?

find all the photos with a certain person or place

folders and tags are different things. tags are not hierarchical

can HTMs help classify?

face recognition like with iPhoto 09
